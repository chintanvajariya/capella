# CAPELLA

Listening to music has been completely rethought.

## What is this?

Capella is a music app that pays users money for listening and provides authentic fanbases & direct feedback to small artists.

Our mission is to provide a platform from which up-and-coming musicians can grow their following, especially when industry giants such as Spotify and Apple Music are just prioritizing their top 250 artists.

## How does it work?

Millions of talented musicians have the potential to become the next big artist. The biggest obstacle in their way has been starting to grow a fanbase. Their best option is to go viral on a social media platform, but the luck involved in that is unimaginable. Trying to advertise to a broad market is even more unimaginably expensive, especially for artists who aren't getting paid. 

That's where we come in. Instead of shelling out hundreds to a local radio station, artists can pay us a small amount, say $10, and in exchange, we'll make their music reach the ears of 100 unique and curated listeners. They'll be exposing curious users to their incredible music, all while gaining feedback and some user data, such as location or genre preferences. In exchange, the user will earn some money (between 10¢-12¢ per song) for simply listening to music. While it may not seem like much, this quickly adds up during a study session or while reading a book.

## Goals

We're in the process of pushing this application to the App Store, but there's still quite a lot of work to be done. We plan to bring this app to the University of Illinois' Cozad New Venture start-up challenge.

## To Be Done

 - Add more genres and sample music for each of them
 - Integrate Gmail/Facebook/email API to allow users to link accounts
 - Integrate Spotify/Apple Music/SoundCloud to allow artists to link their profile and allow users to add songs to their playlists
 - Integrate monetary API to allow deposits from artists and withdrawals from listeners
 - Integrate AWS API to upload user information and run machine learning algorithms to suggest music, along with storing image and music assets
