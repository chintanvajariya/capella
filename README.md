# Capella

Music has been completely rethought.

## What is this?

Capella is a music app that pays users money for listening and provides authentic fanbases & direct feedback to small artists.

Our mission is to provide a platform from which up-and-coming musicians can grow their following, especially when the industry giants such as Spotify and Apple Music are just prioritizing their top 250 artists.

## Goals

We're in the process of pushing this application to the App Store, but there's still quite a lot of work to be done. 

## To Be Done

 - Add more genres and sample music for each of them
 - Integrate Gmail/Facebook/email API to allow users to link accounts
 - Integrate Spotify/Apple Music/SoundCloud to allow artists to link their profile and allow users to add songs to their playlists
 - Integrate monetary API to allow deposits from artists and withdrawals from listeners
 - Integrate AWS API to upload user information and run machine learning algorithms to suggest music, along with storing image and music assets
